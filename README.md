A preview can be seen here: http://dahl.red/VAIO%20HTML%20Wallpaper%202.html

Clone the files in this repository to C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper

Use a tool like rocksdanister's Lively Wallpaper (https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) to set as your desktop wallpaper. *Note you will need to adjust the settings in lively to use WebView2 as the html player under Settings > Wallpaper > Plugins. This will require you to download additional files into the lively plugins folder and install the Windows Desktop runtime package from Microsoft.

This code is probably twice as long as it really needs to be. It's essientially a combination of the original code from Sony's Wallpaper set with other resolutions and bit depths in mind (even though bit depth is not an issue on today's machines, as all are 32 bit color) and updating it to a modern HTML5 format.
